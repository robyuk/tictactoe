# A tic-tac-toe game written in python with pyqt6
The repository contains two python files:
- tic-tac-toe-2player.py    Play with another person on the same screen (or play against yourself)
- tic-tac-toe-1player.py    Play against the computer.  The computer looks for winning lines and places its token to win or block you.  If there is not a winning of block move, it places its token randomly in an available box
